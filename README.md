# FIXING TRON FOR ATARI 2600
---
What if the thing you wanted to repair was the game itself? We thought about that for a while until we settled with the idea of fixing an old cartridge board. Rebuild the circuitry before the electric current reaches the end of the cable. Connect to cards to get bonus points and upgrades, make it quick and compete for the high score!
